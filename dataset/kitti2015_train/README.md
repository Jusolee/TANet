This folder contains the corresponding dataset for this work. In addition to the publicly available KITTI dataset, we used an additional dataset, namely the disparity maps of the previous frame (computed using PSMNet). Therefore, we provide this portion of the data here. For other data, please download them from the official KITTI dataset website.

The specific disparity map used from the previous frame corresponds to the 11th frame's disparity map in a single scene of the KITTI dataset. The data in the "disp_pre" folder is named as "xxx_10.png" to facilitate data retrieval and reading.
