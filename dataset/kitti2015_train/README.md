This folder stores the corresponding dataset.

Due to the use of an additional dataset ---> the disparity map of the previous frame (calculated using PSMNet), in addition to the already open source dataset KITTI, this part of the data is provided here. Please download other data from the KITTI dataset official website.

The previous frame disparity map used is specifically the 11th frame disparity map in a single scene of the KITTI dataset. The data in the "disp_pre" folder is named "xxx_10. png" to facilitate data reading.
